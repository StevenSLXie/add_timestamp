# add_timestamp

This simple Python script adds timestamps to ALL photos in a directory and saves them in a subfolder. 

The timestamp information is extracted from EXIF to record the date when the photo is taken. 

To run the script, simply run the following in the command line

python add_timestamp.py string_of_the_photo_folder
```
